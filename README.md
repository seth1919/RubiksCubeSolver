# Rubik's Cube Solver

See a quick preview of this project on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hw_c57x7XBs&t

This program can solve a Rubik's cube. Enter in the state of your cube using the color picker, or get a random scramble with the scramble button. Press "Step by Step" to follow along or press "Automatic" to see an animation of the cube being solved.
